#### Overview & Example Datasets

**Random forests** or **random decision forests** are an [ensemble learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning) method for [classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification), [regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis) and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of [decision trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) at training time and outputting the class that is the [mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)) of the classes (classification) or mean/average prediction (regression) of the individual trees.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest#cite_note-ho1995-1)[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest#cite_note-ho1998-2) - [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest)

#### How to use this App

1. Upload training data from sidebar panel
2. Go to RF Results tab and select Y and X variables from sidebar panel and then select task at hand i.e. classification or regression
3. Select percentage of data required for training model
4. Tune random forest parameter
5. Click on Train model 



Once your model is trained, You may find training results & corresponding plots in RF Results, RF Plots and Variable Importance Tabs.

#### Predict new dataset

After training the model you can predict new dataset by uploading it from sidebar panel.

Once your data is uploaded, you can download predicted data from Prediction Output tab.

***Note: Prediction data should contains all the features used while training the model.***
